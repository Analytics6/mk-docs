Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays, and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. It was conceived by John Hunter in 2002, originally as a patch to IPython for enabling interactive MATLAB-style plotting via gnuplot from the IPython command line. IPython's creator, Fernando Perez, was at the time scrambling to finish his PhD, and let John know he wouldn\u2019t have time to review the patch for several months. John took this as a cue to set out on his own, and the Matplotlib package was born, with version 0.1 released in 2003. It received an early boost when it was adopted as the plotting package of choice of the Space Telescope Science Institute (the folks behind the Hubble Telescope), which financially supported Matplotlib\u2019s development and greatly expanded its capabilities.</p> <p>One of Matplotlib\u2019s most important features is its ability to play well with many operating systems and graphics backends. Matplotlib supports dozens of backends and output types, which means you can count on it to work regardless of which operating system you are using or which output format you wish. This cross-platform, everything-to-everyone approach has been one of the great strengths of Matplotlib. It has led to a large user base, which in turn has led to an active developer base and Matplotlib\u2019s powerful tools and ubiquity within the scientific Python world.</p> <p>In recent years, however, the interface and style of Matplotlib have begun to show their age. Newer tools like ggplot and ggvis in the R language, along with web visualization toolkits based on D3js and HTML5 canvas, often make Matplotlib feel clunky and old-fashioned. Still, I'm of the opinion that we cannot ignore Matplotlib's strength as a well-tested, cross-platform graphics engine. Recent Matplotlib versions make it relatively easy to set new global plotting styles (see Customizing Matplotlib: Configurations and Style Sheets), and people have been developing new packages that build on its powerful internals to drive Matplotlib via cleaner, more modern APIs\u2014for example, Seaborn (discussed in Visualization With Seaborn), ggpy, HoloViews, Altair, and even Pandas itself can be used as wrappers around Matplotlib's API. Even with wrappers like these, it is still often useful to dive into Matplotlib's syntax to adjust the final plot output. For this reason, I believe that Matplotlib itself will remain a vital piece of the data visualization stack, even if new tools mean the community gradually moves away from using the Matplotlib API directly.</p>"},{"location":"#general-matplotlib-tips","title":"General Matplotlib Tips","text":"<p>Before we dive into the details of creating visualizations with Matplotlib, there are a few useful things you should know about using the package.</p>"},{"location":"#importing-matplotlib","title":"Importing Matplotlib","text":"<p>Just as we use the <code>np</code> shorthand for NumPy and the <code>pd</code> shorthand for Pandas, we will use some standard shorthands for Matplotlib imports:</p> <pre><code>import matplotlib as mpl\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>plt</code> interface is what we will use most often, as we shall see throughout this chapter.</p>"},{"location":"#setting-styles","title":"Setting Styles","text":"<p>We will use the <code>plt.style</code> directive to choose appropriate aesthetic styles for our figures.

How to Display Your Plots","text":"<p>A visualization you can't see won't be of much use, but just how you view your Matplotlib plots depends on the context.

The details of this operation can vary greatly from system to system and even installation to installation, but matplotlib does its best to hide all these details from you.</p> <p>One thing to be aware of: the <code>plt.show()</code> command should be used only once per Python session, and is most often seen at the very end of the script. Multiple <code>show()</code> commands can lead to unpredictable backend-dependent behavior, and should mostly be avoided.</p>"},{"location":"#plotting-from-an-ipython-shell","title":"Plotting from an IPython shell","text":"<p>It can be very convenient to use Matplotlib interactively within an IPython shell (see IPython: Beyond Normal Python).

We'll quickly highlight the differences between the two here.</p>"},{"location":"#matlab-style-interface","title":"MATLAB-style Interface","text":"<p>Matplotlib was originally written as a Python alternative for MATLAB users, and much of its syntax reflects that fact. The MATLAB-style tools are contained in the pyplot (<code>plt</code>) interface. For example, the following code will probably look quite familiar to MATLAB users:</p> <pre><code>plt.figure()  # create a plot figure\n\n# create the first of two panels and set current axis\nplt.subplot(2, 1, 1) # (rows, columns, panel number)\nplt.plot(x, np.sin(x))\n\n# create the second panel and set current axis\nplt.subplot(2, 1, 2)\nplt.plot(x, np.cos(x));\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>It is important to note that this interface is stateful: it keeps track of the \"current\" figure and axes, which are where all <code>plt</code> commands are applied. You can get a reference to these using the <code>plt.gcf()</code> (get current figure) and <code>plt.gca()</code> (get current axes) routines.</p> <p>While this stateful interface is fast and convenient for simple plots, it is easy to run into problems. For example, once the second panel is created, how can we go back and add something to the first? This is possible within the MATLAB-style interface, but a bit clunky. Fortunately, there is a better way.</p>"},{"location":"#object-oriented-interface","title":"Object-oriented interface","text":"<p>The object-oriented interface is available for these more complicated situations, and for when you want more control over your figure. Rather than depending on some notion of an \"active\" figure or axes, in the object-oriented interface the plotting functions are methods of explicit <code>Figure</code> and <code>Axes</code> objects. To re-create the previous plot using this style of plotting, you might do the following:</p> <pre><code># First create a grid of plots\n# ax will be an array of two Axes objects\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(2)\n\n# Call plot() method on the appropriate object\nax[0].plot(x, np.sin(x))\nax[1].plot(x, np.cos(x));\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>For more simple plots, the choice of which style to use is largely a matter of preference, but the object-oriented approach can become a necessity as plots become more complicated. Throughout this chapter, we will switch between the MATLAB-style and object-oriented interfaces, depending on what is most convenient. In most cases, the difference is as small as switching <code>plt.plot()</code> to <code>ax.plot()</code>, but there are a few gotchas that we will highlight as they come up in the following sections.</p> <p>&lt; Further Resources | Contents | Simple Line Plots &gt;</p>"}]}
